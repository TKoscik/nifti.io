Description: A set of tools for reading and writing NIFTI-1 files.
    Including volumewise and voxelwise read and write operations.
    NIFTI files need to be unzipped before using any functions within the nifti.io package. This is necessary given the inconsistent way in which gzipped files are indexed (Some information on this is given in the documentation for the readBin function).
