Description: A set of tools for reading and writing NIfTI-1 files (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative). Unique operations include voxelwise read/write operations and a simplified method to write table contents to NIfTI files. While compressed files cannot be used, memory requirements and read/write speed are optimized.
